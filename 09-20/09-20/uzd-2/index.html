                <h2>Finding simplicity in life</h2>
                <p class="section_p"><b>Life can get complicated really quickly</b>, but it doesn't have to be! There
                    are
                    many ways to simplify your
                    life, <span>a few of which we've explored in the past</span>. This week we're taking a bit of a
                    approach
                    though, in
                    how you can find simplicity in the life you already living. </p>

                    <h2>Keeping cooking simple</h2>
                    <p class="section_p">Food is a very important part of everyone's life. If you want to be healthy,
                        you
                        have to eat healthy.
                        One
                        of the easiest ways to do that is to keep your cooking nice and simple.</p>

                    <h2>Simplicity and work</h2>
                    <p class="section_p">Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it ruins their
                        relationship with
                        others
                        and it leads to burnout. By keeping your work life as simple as possible, it will help balance
                        everything out.</p>

                    <h2>Simple decorations</h2>
                    <p class="section_p">A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either don't
                        decorate,
                        or they go
                        overboard
                        and it doesn't have the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye where
                        you
                        want it to and make things pop like never before.</p>
